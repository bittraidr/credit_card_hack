# credit_card_hack

## Is there any evidence to suggest that a credit card has been hacked? Explain your rationale.
    If trasnactions under $2 potentially suggest that a card has been hacked there as few as 10 different cardholders that potentially have an excessive amount of transactions under $2. Megan Price stands out with 26 transactions under $2, so that card should be analysed for potential hacking. 
    
    
## Do you see any anomalous transactions that could be fraudulent?
    There are 43 showing under $2 for 7 to 9am. 
### Is there a higher number of fraudulent transactions made during this time frame versus the rest of the day
    Out of 353 total transactions under $2 about 12% happen withing the hours of 7am to 9am. I think that is potentially the highest 2 hours period of time during the day for fraudulent transactions. I don't have any concrete theorys as to why because i would think later in the day towards closing times would be the absolute highest because fraudulent transactions would be less likely to be scrutenized as workers generally want to leave their jobs and go home at the end of the day. Perhaps the people doing the hacking are most motivated early in the day. 
    
## What are the top 5 merchants prone to being hacked using small transactions?
1. "Wood-Ramirez"	7
2. "Hood-Phillips"	6
3. "Baker Inc"	6
4. "Mcdaniel, Hines and Mcfarland"	5
5. "Hamilton-Mcfarland"	5
    
# Part 2

## What difference do you observe between the consumption patterns? Does the difference suggest a fraudulent transaction? Explain your rationale.
     Between cardholder 2 and 18 there is a vast difference in consumption patterns. Cardholder 2 keeps their purchases in a range of $.5 to $20. It is more difficult to pinpoint fraud on this cardholder. On the contrary, cardholder 18 has a very wide range of purchase amounts on their card. From $0.60 to $1814 with cardholder 18 there if is potentially easier to identify outliers. 

## Are there any outliers for cardholder ID 25? How many outliers are there per month?
## Do you notice any anomalies? Describe your observations and conclusions.
1 in January 
1 in March
3 in April
1 in May 
3 in June
In observing the box plot the above trasnactions stand out as outliers, these transactions should be examined first. If the owner off the card identifies any of these transactions as fraud they they were outliers, however it is much more difficult to identify fraud if the transaction blends in with other transactions.
